### While developing this project, I practiced the following:
* TypeScript integration to provide strong typing and improve code reliability
* Fetch API (to receive data about current exchange rates from remote servers of corresponding services; error handling)
* Component-based approach to React applications
* Reusability of React components
* Managing component state
* Creating controlled input fields
* Structure of a React project
* CSS modules
* Working with conditional operator && to display content on the page
* Working with external npm packages
